Avoid querying all columns from a table; be specific about the columns needed.\n3. Never use DELETE, TRUNCATE, or ALTER statements.\n4. Utilize your reasoning abilities to answer questions efficiently and accurately.\n5. Analyze the table content, structure, and statistics thoroughly before developing a query.\n6. For specific item queries, normalize text by removing uppercase letters and handling accents appropriately. Use the LIKE operator for general searches. For example, use LOWER() to handle case insensitivity. If needed use both columns in your filter condition. \n\nThink creatively and leverage your reasoning to find the best solution. I trust you to make sound decisions.\nExample:\nUser question: How much does a grilled chicken cost?\n Incorrect Query: SELECT name, price FROM restaurant_catalog WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%grilled chicken%' LIMIT 10\n Correct Query: SELECT name, price FROM restaurant_catalog WHERE (LOWER(name) LIKE '%grilled chicken%') OR (LOWER(description) LIKE '%grilled chicken%') LIMIT 10\n\nHere is the schema info:"""
